### 1. Which package/library did you select?
- I selected the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) library for Python.

### 2. What is the package/library? 
- Pandas serves the purpose of being a high level building block for data analysis in Python [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html).
- Pandas main use comes with its DataFrames. A DataFrame is a table of values with a label for every column and row. The data inside of a DataFrame does not need to consist of only one data type, you can hold multiple data types in the same DataFrame[[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
- It is very easy to import and export tables from Excel, SQL, HTML, .csv files, and many other things which makes it really simple to access the data you need to use and then export it to what ever format you need it in. [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/02_read_write.html)
- It is also very easy to make your own DataFrame rather than importing one which then allows you to export that DataFrame into an Excel spreadsheet for example [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
- You can easily get access to a specific row or column of your DataFrame, a single row/column being a Series which is an array of values that has a label attached to each one, either the row numer or column name in most cases [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).
- There are methods you can use to sort DataFrames by axis, column, row, etc [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).

### 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
- DataFrames are one of the main functionalities, they allow you to store multiple data types in one matrix with labels for each row and column. Example of a dataframe being created [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html):

- Series are another one of the main functionalities, they are arrays that attribute a column name to each element within them. Example of a Series being created [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html):

- An Index is another integral part of pandas, it is what is used to store the labels for all columns and rows of Series and DataFrames. Example of a Index being created [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Index.html):

### 4. When was it created? 
- pandas first started development in 2008, but only became open source during 2009 [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html).

### 5. Why did you select this package/library?
- I selected this package because I was looking for something to do with matrices which led me to find pandas with its DataFrames. I found the DataFrames interesting and could see the many ways they could be used so I decided to do something involving them.

### 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language? 
- Learning pandas helped me understand Python better as a whole through things I hadn't used within it yet. I hadn't used exceptions in Python before this so I got to learn how those worked using the exceptions pandas throws. I had never installed a module in Python either so I had to figure that out, but it isn't that difficult using pip. So learning pandas has taught me things that I hadn't yet done in Python and prepared me more for if/when I will need to do those things in the future.

### 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
- I would recommend using pandas whenever you are working with data that is contained inside of tables. The DataFrames are very good for storing and indexing information inside of tables, allowing you to keep it organized and easily get the data that you need.
- If I ever needed to work with data in tables or spreadsheets I would definitely continue to use pandas. Like I said above it is very easy to get the data you need from DataFrames and it is fairly easy to perform operations on the DataFrames to manipulate the data inside of them as well.
